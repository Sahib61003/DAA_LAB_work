# Design and Analysis of Algorithm Lab

Welcome to the Design and Analysis of Algorithm Lab repository! This repository contains a collection of programs and algorithms that explore various aspects of algorithm design and analysis. Each program is designed to help you understand and implement different algorithms efficiently. Here's a quick overview of the contents:

## Quick Sort Algorithm
1. Sort a set of elements using the Quick Sort algorithm and analyze its time complexity for various input sizes (n).

## Merge Sort Algorithm
2. Implement the Merge Sort algorithm using the divide and conquer method to sort a set of elements. Analyze both the time and space complexity required for sorting.

## Greedy Algorithms
3. Knapsack Problem: Solve the knapsack problem using the greedy method.
4. Job Sequencing with Deadlines: Implement job sequencing with deadlines using a greedy approach.

## Minimum Spanning Trees
5. Prim's Algorithm: Find the minimum cost spanning tree using Prim's algorithm.
6. Kruskal's Algorithm: Find the minimum cost spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.

## Dynamic Programming
7. 0/1 Knapsack Problem: Solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
8. Single Source Shortest Path: Implement the single source shortest path problem for a given graph.
9. Multistage Graph Shortest Path: Find the shortest path for a multistage graph using dynamic programming.

## Backtracking
10. 8-Queens Problem: Solve the 8-queens problem using the backtrack method.

Feel free to explore and experiment with these programs to gain hands-on experience in algorithm design and analysis. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding and algorithm exploration! üìäüîçüß†
